## About React JS
![react](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43074604/124001629-a77b7400-d9f6-11eb-9ba7-6fd4320a961c.png)

ReactJS is the highly used open-source JavaScript Library. It helps in creating impressive web apps that require minimal effort and coding. The main objective of ReactJS is to develop User Interfaces (UI) that improves the speed of the apps. 

### Advantage of ReactJS :

* It is easy to learn.
* A virtual DOM is used.
* There are reusable components.
* Operates on a one-way data flow.
* SEO friendliness.


### Cons of ReactJS :

* JSX syntax.
* Fast development pace.
* Somewhat slow documentation.

ReactJS is a very efficient development framework that can be used to help developers create faster web apps with powerful User Interfaces.There are pros and cons of React, but I think many of the cons associated with ReactJS are due to people not liking rapid changes. 

There is nothing wrong with constant development. You could make the argument that rapid development is one of the strongest advantages of React. Technology improves at an  exponential rate. Newer technology will develop even more rapidly than ReactJS. Development is an exciting step towards the new future of tech. 


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The project can be built with npm or yarn, so choose one of the approach bellow in case you don't have any installed on your system.

npm is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), you automatically get npm installed on your computer. Download Node.js
or

Yarn is a package manager built by Facebook Team and seems to be faster than npm in general. Download Yarn
